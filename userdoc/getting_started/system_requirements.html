	<p>
		Form Tools has very minimal server and browser requirements, enabling it to run on
		the vast majority of web servers. The web browser requirements are only for
		administrators and clients who log in to view and manage their form submissions.
		Regular website visitors submitting content may use whatever browser and OS they wish.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>PHP 4.3+ <span class="light_grey">[N.B. Form Tools 2 will be the last version that supports PHP 4]</span></li>
		<li>MySQL 4+</li>
		<li>PHP Sessions (after installation, you can move to database sessions by setting the <b>$g_session_type</b> variable
			in your <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/getting_started/config_file">config.php file</a>)</li>
		<li>PHP mail() function or SMTP for sending emails (see the
			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/swift_mailer/">Swift Mailer</a> module for further
			information on the SMTP option)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You will need a MySQL user account which has permissions to create new tables within
		a database. If you are not sure about this, you should contact your hosting
		company.
	</p>

	<p>
		You will need to be able to set folder permissions on your website. Specifically,
		for file uploads, your upload folder(s) will need to have write permissions. Also,
		the Smarty cache folder will need to have full write-permissions to let the
		temporary files be created.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have a choice of servers, I would <b>strongly</b> recommend choosing a UNIX
		environment. In the past, the vast majority of problems have occurred on Windows
		servers.
